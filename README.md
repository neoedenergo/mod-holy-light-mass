Scripted event for the holy light mass.

Scripted scene that automatically triggers at 11:55 server time each day of the week, the scene is basically a christian-like mass but with the holy light of WoW instead, it would consist of several NPCs that spawn outside doors of houses in stormwind and walk towards the cathedral, when they arrive they stand in formation, then the priest appears and says a couple things, the church attenders respond to some prayers in unison, when it's over, they leave all the way to their houses and all the NPCs despawn.

The priest will make a reference to the current day of the week.


Priest Fermin = P

Church = C



P: The Holy Light be with you.

C: And with your spirit

5 seconds pause

P: Have mercy on us, O Holy Light. 

C: For we are not perfect.

P: Show us, O Holy Light, your mercy.

C: And grant us your salvation.

P: May the almighty Holy Light have mercy on us, guide us and bring us to everlasting life.

C: Amen.

P: Go in peace, glorifying the Holy Light by your life.

they kneel in unison

emotes

also player attendees will receive a buff for a couple hours

Valuable teachings will be made into an array out of which items will be chosen in a random manner for the speech of each mass.

The buff that players get will correspond to the item randomly chosen for the day, it will be thematic, for example the theme of faith will correspond to stats related to luck, like critical chance %.
